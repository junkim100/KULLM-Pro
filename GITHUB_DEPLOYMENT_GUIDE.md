## üöÄ GitHub Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** and sign in to your account (`junkim100`)

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `KULLM-Pro`
   - Description: `Korean-English Code-Switched Language Model Training Pipeline`
   - Set to **Public** (recommended for open source)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **Repository settings:**
   - Add topics: `machine-learning`, `nlp`, `code-switching`, `korean`, `fine-tuning`, `lora`, `openai`
   - Enable Issues and Projects
   - Enable Wikis if desired

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your local repository:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /data_x/junkim100/projects/KULLM/KULLM-Pro

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/junkim100/KULLM-Pro.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Configure Repository Settings

After pushing, configure these settings on GitHub:

#### Branch Protection
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators

#### Repository Secrets
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add repository secrets for CI/CD:
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` (for code coverage reporting)
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (for future package publishing)

#### GitHub Pages (Optional)
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: `main` / `docs` (if you want to serve documentation)

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

After pushing, verify:

1. **Repository Structure:**
   - All files are present and properly organized
   - README.md displays correctly with badges
   - License is properly detected by GitHub

2. **GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Verify CI workflow is available
   - Check that workflows are properly configured

3. **Issues and PRs:**
   - Go to Issues tab
   - Click "New issue" to verify templates work
   - Check that PR template is available

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### Update Badge URLs

The badges in README.md are already configured for your repository:
- CI badge: `https://github.com/junkim100/KULLM-Pro/workflows/CI/badge.svg`
- Codecov badge: `https://codecov.io/gh/junkim100/KULLM-Pro/branch/main/graph/badge.svg`

### Set Up Integrations

1. **Codecov Integration:**
   - Go to https://codecov.io/
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Add your repository
   - Copy the token to repository secrets

2. **Pre-commit.ci Integration:**
   - Go to https://pre-commit.ci/
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Enable for your repository

### Create First Release

1. **Create a tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **GitHub will automatically:**
   - Trigger the release workflow
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Generate release notes from CHANGELOG.md

## üìä Repository Statistics

After deployment, your repository will contain:

- **39 files** across multiple directories
- **7,103 lines** of production-ready code
- **Complete documentation** with guides and examples
- **CI/CD workflows** for automated testing and releases
- **Issue and PR templates** for community contributions
- **Comprehensive test suite** with fixtures and mocks

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test installation** from GitHub:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/junkim100/KULLM-Pro.git
   ```

2. **Verify CLI commands** work:
   ```bash
   code-switch --help
   fine-tune --help
   ```

3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

### Community Setup
1. **Create initial discussions** categories
2. **Pin important issues** or announcements
3. **Set up project board** for tracking development
4. **Add contributors** if working with a team

### Documentation
1. **Create GitHub Wiki** pages for advanced topics
2. **Add more examples** based on user feedback
3. **Create video tutorials** or demos
4. **Set up documentation site** (optional)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Push rejected:**
```bash
# If you get authentication errors
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/junkim100/KULLM-Pro.git
# Use personal access token for authentication
```

**Workflows not running:**
- Check that `.github/workflows/` directory was pushed
- Verify YAML syntax in workflow files
- Check repository permissions for Actions

**Badges not working:**
- Wait a few minutes after first push
- Verify repository name matches badge URLs
- Check that workflows have run at least once

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub's documentation
2. Verify all files were pushed correctly
3. Check repository settings and permissions
4. Review workflow logs for errors

## ‚úÖ Deployment Complete!

Once you've completed these steps, KULLM-Pro will be:
- ‚úÖ **Publicly available** on GitHub
- ‚úÖ **Professionally documented** with comprehensive guides
- ‚úÖ **Ready for contributions** with proper templates and workflows
- ‚úÖ **Automatically tested** with CI/CD pipelines
- ‚úÖ **Production ready** for research and development use

**Congratulations! KULLM-Pro is now successfully deployed to GitHub! üéâ**
